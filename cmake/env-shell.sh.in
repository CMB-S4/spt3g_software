# Script to set environment variables.
# Usage:
#  - env-shell.sh with no arguments opens a new shell (whatever you are using)
#    with all the PYTHONPATH and such things configured
#  - env-shell.sh command runs command with all the PYTHONPATH and such things
#    configured, then exits to the previous environment

# Things can get confusing if we load this multiple times
