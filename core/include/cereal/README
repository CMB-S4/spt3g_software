This is the cereal library, as of 11/4/2019. The following patches have been applied:
- All std::shared_ptr and friends replaced by boost::shared_ptr and friends using sed for compatibility with boost::python.
- Instances of nullptr removed when initializing boost::shared_ptr for compatibility with ancient boost versions

Sed script:
sed -E -I '' -e 's/std::shared_ptr/boost::shared_ptr/g' -e 's/std::static_pointer_cast/boost::static_pointer_cast/g' -e 's/std::dynamic_pointer_cast/boost::dynamic_pointer_cast/g' -e 's/std::make_shared/boost::make_shared/g'
